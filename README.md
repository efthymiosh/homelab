# Efthymios' Homelab

A collection of IaC, configuration, and text describing my adventures with building my
homelab on 4 Intel NUCs and a gigabit switch.

When done, the collection of text will be exposed on [efhd.me](efhd.me) running on the
infrastructure defined as IaC and configuration in this repo.
